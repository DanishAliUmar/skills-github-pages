## Popular React Design Patterns

Let's dive into some of the most widely used design patterns in React development.

### 1. Container-Presenter Pattern

The **Container-Presenter** pattern is a powerful way to separate your component's logic from the UI. Here's how it works:

- **Container**: Focuses on managing state and business logic.
- **Presenter**: Handles UI rendering, with props passed down from the container.

**Advantages**:
- Keeps your components clean and readable.
- Makes components easier to test.

```jsx
// Container Component
function UserContainer() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetching user data
    fetchUser().then(setUser);
  }, []);

  return <UserPresenter user={user} />;
}

// Presenter Component
function UserPresenter({ user }) {
  if (!user) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}
